# ampache-sandstorm-prototype
Purpose: Create an initial packaging prototype of Ampache on Sandstorm

## General strategy

### Phase 1: Experimentation

- Import the most recent release of Ampache into this repo.

- Make it work in Sandstorm as a proof of concept. Lots of hacks and anything else
  are OK in Phase 1.

### Phase 2: Work with upstream

- If this experiment works well, then we'll fork the upstream Ampache repository
  on GitHub and contribute changes to our fork, plus synchronize periodically with
  upstream to get the latest upstream code, plus push our changes upstream via pull
  requests.

- In Phase 2, we should try to write code that is worthy of being released! :)

- Then presumably we will be able to erase this repository.
